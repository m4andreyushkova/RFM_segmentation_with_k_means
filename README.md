# RFM_segmentation_with_k_means
The goal of the task is to perform k-means clustering of customers based on the RFM-segmentation method (clustering in the feature subspace corresponding to RFM components). RFM-segmentation is one of the most common strategies for dividing customers based on "loyalty" and involves segmentation based on three features:

- Recency: the amount of time elapsed since the customer's last purchase.
- Frequency: the number of purchases made over the entire time period.
- Monetary value: the total amount of money spent by the customer over the entire time period.

The data preprocessing includes feature engineering for RFM-segmentation, handling missing values and outliers in the data, scaling, and normalization. Then, the optimal parameter k for the k-means clustering method is determined, and an interpretation of the formed clusters is provided.
